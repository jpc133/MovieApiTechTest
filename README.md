# Movie API TechTest
Created as part of an interview process.

## Running the API
This was built in .NET Core 3.1 using ASP.NET Core - it also uses CSVHelper from Nuget (https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/), it has no other special requirements so should run in Visual Studio without any special attention
